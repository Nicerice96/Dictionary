# Interactive_dataset_analyzer


Project Goal: 

The goal of this project was to build an interactive dataset analyzer program that would
allow the user to enter a file containing a list of books (with the book's information) upon which
the user is then prompted to enter a command. Once the command has been entered, the dataset
analyzer would analyze the file and return the analyzed data to the user.

The Project Design:

The program will behave as described in the following steps:

1) A user interface will prompt the user to enter a command however if the user inputs a
command other than “L” to load the data file, the user interface will prompt the user to
load a file.

2) Once the user loads a file, the program will ask to enter another command at which this
point the user can input a command to perform an action on the data using the analyzer (file named analyzer).

3) The program will then analyze the data and perform an action (like add a book or remove
a book etc.) and return the analyzed data to the user

4) The program will continue to the prompt the user until the user enters “Q” to exit the
program
